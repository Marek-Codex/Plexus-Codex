## Installation

### üöÄ One-Line Install (Recommended)
Install directly from GitHub using PowerShell (Run as Administrator):

```powershell
# Interactive installer/uninstaller
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marek-Codex/Plexus-Codex/main/Codex-Manager.ps1 | iex

# Direct install
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marek-Codex/Plexus-Codex/main/Codex-Manager.ps1 | iex -Install

# Direct uninstall
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marek-Codex/Plexus-Codex/main/Codex-Manager.ps1 | iex -Uninstall
```

### üì• Alternative: Download Batch File
For users who prefer a GUI experience:
1. Download [`Codex-Manager.bat`](Codex-Manager.bat)
2. Right-click and "Run as Administrator"
3. Follow the on-screen prompts

### üõ†Ô∏è Manual Installation
If you prefer manual installation:

1. **Download this repository**
2. **Run as Administrator**: Right-click PowerShell and select "Run as Administrator"
3. **Navigate to the Codex folder**
4. **Run the installation script**:
   ```powershell
   .\Install.ps1
   ```
   The `.\Install.ps1` script handles registry importation with corrected paths. Manual import of `Codex.reg` is not recommended as it contains placeholder paths. The script also sets the required PowerShell execution policy.

## Usage

After installation, right-click on the desktop or in any folder to access the Codex menu.

- Switch to High Performance power plan
- Disable CPU throttling
- Set CPU minimum and maximum states to 100%
- Stop unnecessary Windows services
- Set high priority for gaming processes

### Dynamic Boost Intelligence
Dynamic Boost analyzes your system every 10 seconds and:
- Detects running games automatically
- Monitors CPU, Memory, and GPU usage
- Switches to Gaming mode when games are detected with high load
- Uses High Performance for intensive non-gaming tasks
- Falls back to Balanced for normal operation
- Switches to Power Saver when on battery with low load

## Requirements
- Windows 10/11
- PowerShell 5.0 or later
- Administrator privileges for installation
- Administrator privileges for some features (GameTurbo, system cleanup)

## Uninstallation

### Automatic Uninstallation (Recommended)
```powershell
# Recommended: Use the Codex Manager script
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marek-Codex/Plexus-Codex/main/Codex-Manager.ps1 | iex -Uninstall

# Alternative (if you know your installation path):
# 1. Navigate to your Codex installation directory (e.g., C:\ProgramData\Plexus\Codex or %LOCALAPPDATA%\Plexus\Codex)
# 2. Open the 'Scripts' subfolder.
# 3. Run PowerShell as Administrator in this folder and execute:
#    .\Uninstall-Codex.ps1
```

**Uninstaller Options:**
- `.\Uninstall-Codex.ps1` - Interactive uninstall with prompts
- `.\Uninstall-Codex.ps1 -Force` - Automatic uninstall (no prompts)
- `.\Uninstall-Codex.ps1 -KeepFiles` - Remove registry only, keep files
- `.\Uninstall-Codex.ps1 -Quiet` - Silent uninstall (no output)

### Manual Uninstallation
If the automatic uninstaller fails:
1. Open Registry Editor (regedit) as Administrator
2. Navigate to `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell\`
3. Delete the `Codex` key
4. Restart Windows Explorer or reboot
5. Optionally delete the Codex folder

## Notes
- Some features require Administrator privileges
- GameTurbo may temporarily disable certain Windows services
- Dynamic Boost runs continuous monitoring when activated
- RoboCopy operations are stored temporarily for RoboPaste functionality

## Troubleshooting

**Scripts not running**: Check execution policy with `Get-ExecutionPolicy`
**No context menu**: Ensure registry was imported as Administrator
**GameTurbo not working**: Run PowerShell as Administrator
**Dynamic Boost issues**: Check if games are properly detected in the process list

## Advanced Usage

### Running Dynamic Boost in Monitor Mode
For continuous system monitoring:
```powershell
.\Scripts\DynamicBoost.ps1 -Monitor
```

This will run Dynamic Boost in a continuous monitoring mode that analyzes and adjusts performance every 10 seconds.
