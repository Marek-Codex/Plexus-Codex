## Requirements
- Windows 10/11
- PowerShell 5.0 or later
- Administrator privileges for installation
- Administrator privileges for some features (GameTurbo, system cleanup)

## Uninstallation

### Automatic Uninstallation (Recommended)
Run the uninstaller script as Administrator:
```powershell
# Navigate to Codex directory
cd "C:\Users\Marek\Plexus Codex\Codex\Scripts"

# Run uninstaller
.\Uninstall-Codex.ps1
```

**Uninstaller Options:**
- `.\Uninstall-Codex.ps1` - Interactive uninstall with prompts
- `.\Uninstall-Codex.ps1 -Force` - Automatic uninstall (no prompts)
- `.\Uninstall-Codex.ps1 -KeepFiles` - Remove registry only, keep files
- `.\Uninstall-Codex.ps1 -Quiet` - Silent uninstall (no output)

### Manual Uninstallation
If the automatic uninstaller fails:
1. Open Registry Editor (regedit) as Administrator
2. Navigate to `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell\`
3. Delete the `Codex` key
4. Restart Windows Explorer or reboot
5. Optionally delete the Codex folder

## Notes
- Some features require Administrator privileges
- GameTurbo may temporarily disable certain Windows services
- Dynamic Boost runs continuous monitoring when activated
- RoboCopy operations are stored temporarily for RoboPaste functionality

## Troubleshooting

**Scripts not running**: Check execution policy with `Get-ExecutionPolicy`
**No context menu**: Ensure registry was imported as Administrator
**GameTurbo not working**: Run PowerShell as Administrator
**Dynamic Boost issues**: Check if games are properly detected in the process list

## Advanced Usage

### Running Dynamic Boost in Monitor Mode
For continuous system monitoring:
```powershell
.\Scripts\DynamicBoost.ps1 -Monitor
```

This will run Dynamic Boost in a continuous monitoring mode that analyzes and adjusts performance every 10 seconds.
